Restaurant doesn't answer the phone, and Swiggy doesn't have any clue on the delivery timelines. The only answer you get from Swiggy is that the restaurant will deliver, so we will not have any update. You can't cancel the order, and if you do so, you will be losing all the money. This is really stupid, SWIGGY and EAT CLUB (ZAZA Mughal Biryani)",
